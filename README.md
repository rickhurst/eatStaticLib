eatStaticLib
============

PHP5 library for use with eatStaticBlog (as a submodule) and other personal projects. This is an assortment of PHP5 classes that I initially created for [eatStatic blog](http://eatstatic.olivewoodstudio.com), but now commonly drop into any PHP5 project to make use of common helpers in eatStatic.class.php and ad-hoc object persistence and retrieval as json (stored either on the filesystem or in a db).

I am in the process of updating all current projects to load this as a submodule, to help keep track of upstream bugfixes and additions.
